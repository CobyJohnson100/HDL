# Hardware Description Language (HDL)

This repository is dedicated to my personal experimentation and learning journey with Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Here, I explore various concepts, techniques, and tools related to HDL, aiming to deepen my understanding and practical skills.

## Purpose

- Experiment with HDL concepts and syntax.
- Implement and test hardware designs.
- Document my learning progress and insights.

## VHDL

This section focuses on VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), a powerful language used for describing the behavior and structure of electronic systems. The repository includes:

- **VHDL Examples:** Practical code snippets and projects written in VHDL.
- **VHDL Notes:** Personal notes and observations on VHDL concepts and syntax.
- **VHDL Experiments:** Various tests and explorations to understand VHDL behavior.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the repository, review the examples, and experiment with the code. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome as they help enhance the learning experience.

## Tools and Technologies

- VHDL
- Simulation and synthesis tools
- FPGA development boards (optional)

## Disclaimer

This repository is purely for educational and experimental purposes. The code and examples provided here may not be optimized or suitable for production use.

## Getting Started

I work in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), within Linux environment testing using GHDL
`sudo apt-get install ghdl`

Need gtkwave to visualize simulation results
`sudo apt-get install gtkwave`
