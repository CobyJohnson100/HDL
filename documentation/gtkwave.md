# Understanding GTKWave

GTKWave is a waveform viewer that allows you to visualize the simulation results of your VHDL designs. When you open a VCD (Value Change Dump) file in GTKWave, you will see a graphical representation of the signals in your design over time. Here's a basic guide to help you understand what you're looking at:

## Key Components of GTKWave

1. **Signal Pane**: 
   - Located on the left side, this pane lists all the signals available in your simulation. You can select which signals to display in the waveform pane by dragging them from the signal pane to the waveform pane.

2. **Waveform Pane**:
   - This is the main area where the waveforms are displayed. Each signal is shown as a horizontal line, with changes in value represented as transitions on the line. Time progresses from left to right.

3. **Time Scale**:
   - The horizontal axis represents time. You can zoom in and out to see more or less detail in the waveform.

4. **Signal Values**:
   - The vertical axis represents the values of the signals. For digital signals, you will typically see binary values (e.g., `0`, `1`, `X` for unknown, `Z` for high impedance).

5. **Cursor**:
   - You can place a cursor on the waveform to measure time intervals or to see the exact value of a signal at a specific time.

## Interpreting the Waveforms

- **Transitions**: A change in the signal value is shown as a vertical transition. For example, a transition from `0` to `1` indicates a rising edge.
  
- **Signal States**: 
  - `0` and `1` represent logical low and high, respectively.
  - `X` indicates an unknown state, which can occur if the signal is not driven.
  - `Z` indicates a high-impedance state, often used in tri-state logic.

- **Time Measurement**: You can use the cursor to measure the time between events. This is useful for verifying timing constraints or delays in your design.

## Common Actions

- **Zooming**: Use the mouse wheel or the zoom buttons to zoom in and out of the waveform.
- **Panning**: Click and drag the waveform to pan left or right.
- **Adding Signals**: Drag signals from the signal pane to the waveform pane to add them to the view.
- **Removing Signals**: Right-click on a signal in the waveform pane and select "Remove" to take it out of the view.

## Example: Analyzing an AND Gate

In your specific case with the AND gate:

- You should see the input signals `a` and `b`, and the output signal `y`.
- The output `y` should only be `1` when both `a` and `b` are `1`.
- You can verify this by observing the transitions in the waveform and ensuring that `y` matches the expected behavior of an AND gate.

GTKWave is a powerful tool for debugging and verifying digital designs, and with practice, you'll become more comfortable interpreting the waveforms. If you have specific questions about what you're seeing, feel free to ask!
